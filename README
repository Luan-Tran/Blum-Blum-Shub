# Blum-Blum-Shub

This is a simple implementation of the Blum Blum Shub algorithm that was described 
in Bruce Schneier's book, Applied Cryptography.The main file takes in a file to 
write too, the number of keys to generate, the length of key, and whether testing should be done.

Ex: Creates or overwrites listOfKeys.txt and writes 10 keys to file
./BBS listOfKeys.txt 10 2048 0

Ex: Test pseudo random number generator, no keys will be written to file.
./BBS listOfKeys.txt 10 2048 1
