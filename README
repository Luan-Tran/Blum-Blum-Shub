# Blum-Blum-Shub

This is a simple implementation of the Blum Blum Shub algorithm that was described in Bruce Schneier's book, Applied Cryptography.
The main file was created to demonstrate the algorithm and generate keys that are printed to the console.
The implementation of the algorithm is in BBS.c, with useful functions that allow the algorithm to be used in other files.
